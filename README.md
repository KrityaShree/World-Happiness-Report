# World Happiness Report Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis Project done from March 2020 to May 2020

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the World Happiness Report, which assesses the happiness levels of 138 countries based on various factors. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and visualization tools, we delve into the dataset to understand the factors influencing happiness scores and trends over the years.

## Objectives
- Analyze the happiness levels of countries based on factors like GDP, social support, health, freedom, generosity, and government trust.
- Identify the top 10 happiest and unhappiest countries and analyze their progress from 2015 to 2020.
- Explore correlations between happiness scores and contributing factors.
- Predict future happiness trends based on historical data.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: The dataset is obtained from Kaggle, sourced from the Gallup World Poll.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transformation techniques are applied to prepare the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various visualization techniques such as heatmaps, bar graphs, and correlation matrices are used to explore relationships between variables.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Trends in happiness scores over time are analyzed to understand country-specific patterns.
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive modeling is used to forecast future happiness scores based on historical data.

## Key Findings
- Happiness scores are influenced by factors like GDP, social support, health, freedom, generosity, and government trust.
- The top 10 happiest countries consistently exhibit high scores across multiple factors, with slight variations over the years.
- Unhappiest countries show lower scores in critical areas such as social support, health, and freedom.
- Trends indicate fluctuations in happiness scores over time, influenced by economic, social, and political factors.
